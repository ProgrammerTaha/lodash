/*

! implementing ten methods of lodash library that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

todo In implementing each method, we will follow these four steps:
% Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
% Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
% Implement our game plan
% Test our code to ensure it works as expected

*/

//create an object to contain methods and then run tests on them through node _.js and node test/lodash.js

//.clamp() takes three arguments: a number, a lower bound, and an upper bound
//.clamp() modifies the provided number to be within the two provided bounds
//If the provided number is smaller than the lower bound, it will return the lower bound as the final number
//If the number is larger than the upper bound, it will return the upper bound as the final number
//If the number is already within the two bounds, it will return the number as the final number
